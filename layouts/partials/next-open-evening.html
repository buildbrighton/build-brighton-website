<span class="next-open-evening-date"><b>Covid-19 Update:</b> Build Brighton is once again accepting new members!<br /><br />
Open evenings have resumed, allowing you to visit the space, take a look around, and ask any questions you may have. If you're interested in joining, we can run you through the sign up process. 
<br /><br />
Open Evenings are usually held Thursdays 6-9pm, with some irregular weekend afternoon dates available on enquiry. You can arrange to attend one now if you would like to join.<br /><br />
There are currently spaces available, though there has been a high level of interest post-lockdown, so we'd advise attending an open evening and joining ASAP to secure a space. If you are interested in joining, or you have any questions, please e-mail info@buildbrighton.com.
<br /><br />
The rule of 6 for indoor mixing is applied, with sanitiser freely provided in the space. Members use a booking system and personalised electronic keys to log entry to the space and 
ensure your sessions do not exceed 6 simulatenous users. At 1300 square feet, social distancing within the workshop is easily achievable.
<br /><br />
Users must wear face masks and sanitise regularly while in the space, and practice social distancing between users of Build Brighton and other studios.
<br /><br />
We look forward to meeting you!
