We’re part of a global network of makerspaces, membership of Build Brighton starts at £25 a month. Build Brighton is very affordable - we are a 
community of makers who help each other to make stuff and understand techniques. Our members do all club management, club improvements, equipment upkeep/repairs and so on. We plan to have social evenings and maker workshop covering things like 3D printing, CNC, Arduino, ESP32 and other technologies. 

We are accepting applications for membership, but before applying to join, please come along to an open evening, to make sure the space meets your needs and to find out more.

Open Evenings are usually held alternate Thursdays at 6 pm. If you cannot make it on Thursday evenings, let us know and we will try and work something out. 

You can arrange to attend an Open Evening or put any questions by emailing us at: open@buildbrighton.com

At an Open Evening we will show you round, answer your questions, explain how the club works and cover how you apply for membership. 

Remember we are all unpaid volunteers so sometimes it may take a few days for a reply. If you get no reply after five days, email us again in case something went wrong. If there is a high rate of COVID we may ask you to wear face coverings while in our space to minimise 
cross infection but this is not currently needed.
