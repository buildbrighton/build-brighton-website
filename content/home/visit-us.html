        <p>Open evenings are an informal event where members regularly come to work on projects, get help, share ideas, and socialise. It’s also the best opportunity for visitors to come along for the first time.</p>
        <p>We will give you a tour so you can get a feel for the type of projects being worked on, meet some of our members, and see the equipment and resources we have before you join.</p>
        <p>You can find us at: <a href="{{< param googleMaps >}}">Rodhus Studios (back entrance), Freehold Terrace, Brighton, BN2 4AB</a>. Please <a href="{{< ref "#contact-us" >}}">get in touch</a> to let us know you're planning to come along.</p>
