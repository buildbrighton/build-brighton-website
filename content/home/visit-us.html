        <p>You can find us at: <a href="{{< param googleMaps >}}">Rodhus Studios, Freehold Terrace, Brighton, BN2 4AB.</a> Please <a href="{{< ref "#contact-us" >}}">get in touch</a> to let us know you're planning to come along using the email address below. Our entrance is in Freehold terrace which is just off Hollingdean Road, near the Vogue gyratory and Sainsbury’s. Parking is limited in the area but you can park in the Sainsbury’s car park if you shop there but do not leave your car there after 10PM and it will be locked in! </p>
        <p> We are accepting applications for membership, but before applying to join, please come along to an open evening , to make sure the space meets your needs and to find out more. Open Evenings are usually held alternate Thursdays 6-8:30pm.   If you cannot make it on Thursday evenings, let us know and we will try and work something out. </p>
        <p> You can arrange to attend an Open Evening or put any questions by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:open@buildbrighton.com">open@buildbrighton.com </a> </p>

<p> At an Open Evening we will show you round, answer your questions, explain how the club works and explain how you apply for membership (press the button!). We always take one month’s payment via Gocardless before approving membership (to check you are solvent) but any actual payment will obviously be refunded if you application fails (this is extremely unlikely). 
<p> Remember we are all unpaid volunteers so sometimes it may take a few days for a reply. If you get no reply after five days, email us again in case something went wrong. </p> 
<p> <em>If there is a high rate of COVID we may ask you to wear face coverings while in our space to minimise cross infection but this is not currently needed. </em> </p>

<h2>We look forward to meeting you! </h2>
