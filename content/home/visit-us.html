        <p>Open evenings are an informal event where members regularly come to work on projects, get help, share ideas, and socialise. Itâ€™s also the best opportunity for visitors to come along for the first time.</p>
        <p>We will give you a tour so you can get a feel for the type of projects being worked on, meet some of our members, and see the equipment and resources we have before you join.</p>
        <p>You can find us at: <a href="{{< param googleMaps >}}">Rodhus Studios, Freehold Terrace, Brighton, BN2 4AB</a>. Please <a href="{{< ref "#contact-us" >}}">get in touch</a> to let us know you're planning to come along.</p>
